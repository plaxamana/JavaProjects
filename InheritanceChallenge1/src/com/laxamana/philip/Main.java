	    *
	    * Start with the base class of Vehicle, then create a Car class that inherits from this class
	    * Finally, create another class, a specific type of Car that inherits from the car class
	    * You should be able to handle steering, changing gears, and moving (speed)
	    * You will want to decide the appropriate state and behaviors (fields and methods)
	    * As mentioned above, changing gears, increasing/decreasing speed should be included.
	    * For your specific type of vehicle, you will want to add something specific for that type of car.*/
